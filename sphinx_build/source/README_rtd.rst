Introduction
============

`ArchPy` package is a tool to create, manipulate and vizualize 3D geological and petro-physical models of the subsurface.
It relies on a hierarchical approach to generate these models at different spatial scales.
The input data consists of a set of borehole data and a stratigraphic pile. 
The stratigraphic pile describes formally and in a compact manner how the model should be constructed,
such as the relations between the geological features or the modelling parameters.

ArchPy offers a variety of capabilities such as:

   - Various interpolation methods (GRF, Kriging, Spline, etc.)
   - Various simulation methods (MPS, SIS, TPGs, etc.)
   - Coupling with groundwater flow using MODFLOW and flopy
   - Integration of hierarchy in the modelling process at different spatial scales
   - Input/Output capabilities to read and write borehole data, stratigraphic pile and models
   - Automatic inference of conditioning point 
   - Automatic and manual interface for inference of surface parameters
   - Can handle raster and shapefile data
   - Can handle geological maps
   - Cross-validation capabilities
   - and many more...

`ArchPy` is a pure  Swiss product (|:fondue:|), produced by the `Randlab <https://www.unine.ch/philippe.renard/de/home.html>`_ at University of Neuch√¢tel.
 
Installation
------------

`ArchPy` is available on `Pypi <https://pypi.org/project/geoarchpy>`_ and can be installed with pip::

   pip install geoarchpy[all]

OR 

`ArchPy` can be installed locally with::

   pip install .


when in the main directory.

Alternatively, it is possible to add `ArchPy` path directly in the python script with sys::

   sys.path.append("path where ArchPy is") 

and then import `ArchPy`.

Requirements
------------
ArchPy has been tested with python>=3.8
